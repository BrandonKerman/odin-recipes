        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><strong>Shrimp Ceviche</strong> is one of the ultimate healthy Mexican dishes. 
            Fresh seafood + lots of “good for you” veggies. It <em>can't</em> get better 
            than this! Serve it as an appetizer or as a light meal accompanied with tostadas, 
            saltines or tortilla chips.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h4>Main ingredient</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>raw shrimp (peeled and deveined)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Veggies</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>cucumbers</li>
            <li>tomatoes</li>
            <li>onions</li>
            <li>jalapeños</li>
            <li>limes</li>
            <li>fresh cilantro</li>
            <li>avocados</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>The "juice"</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>clamato or V8 tomato juice</li>
            <li>salt & pepper to taste</li>
            <li>hot sauce</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut shrimp into very small pieces and place in a plastic or glass container 
                (don’t use metal as the acid from the lime does not go well with this 
                material)
            </li>
            <li>Add enough lime juice making sure all of the shrimp is covered with it. I 
                recommend you use a citrus squeezer for easiness! <em>An “esprimidor” 
                (manual lemon/lime juicer) it’s one of those kitchen gadgets I recommend 
                to every Mexican Food lover!</em>
            </li>
            <li>Cover the shrimp’s container with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 
                three hours but preferably overnight.
            </li>
            <li>While the shrimp is marinating, start cutting the veggies and place in 
                refrigerator.
            </li>
            <li>When the shrimp is cooked through (it will be pink), add the vegetables 
                (except avocado), clamato juice, salt & pepper and mix well.
            </li>
            <li>
                Lastly add the avocado and fold gently into the mix.
            </li>
        </ol>
