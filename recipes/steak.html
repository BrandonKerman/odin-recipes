        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><strong>Gordon Says</strong>: If you follow these simple rules, it's going to be easy. 
            Let the pan get nice and hot. If there's no heat inside the pan, <em>there's no 
            color</em>. If there's no color, <em>there's no flavor</em>. Make sure the steak is 
            relaxed, meaning it's at room temperature. A relaxed steak will cook quicker, and 
            won't be stone cold inside the center.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Ribeye (or really any cut of steak)</li>
            <li>Large grain sea salt</li>
            <li>Ground pepper</li>
            <li>1-2 Tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>Fresh garlic slight crushed</li>
            <li>Fresh thyme</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp butter</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make sure your steaks are completely thawed. Remove them from the fridge and allow 
                them to sit outside fridge for AT LEAST 20 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Put a pan over medium-high heat. Season thawed steaks with a good amount of large 
                grain salt (sea salt) and ground pepper, rub bottom of steaks with excess salt and 
                pepper that has fallen onto table.
            </li>
            <li>Once pan begins to smoke drop 1-2 Tbsp of olive oil in and coat pan in it. Lay steaks 
                away from you into pan and let sear for one minute on each side. There should be three 
                sides you sear (top, bottom, and fat side). Render the fat throughout all the cooking.
                <br> <!--this break tag represents a line break-->
                <em>Note: to render fat, tilt pan up and and lean steaks against far edge of pan as 
                    you see below.</em>
            </li>
            <li>Crush some fresh garlic, pinch off some fresh thyme, grab another Tbsp of olive oil 
                and add it to pan around steaks while continuing to turn the steaks every minute.
            </li>
            <li>Add 2 Tbsp of butter to hot pan and baste the steaks by scooping melted butter on top 
                of the cooking steaks.
                <br>
                <em>Pro Tip: Gordon tells you to check tenderness by equating the tenderness of your 
                    palm to rare, top of the wrist as medium, and just below that as well done. It is 
                    difficult for me to use that method, so I use cheek as rare, chin as medium, and 
                    forehead as well done.</em>
            </li>
            <li>Continue basting and turning steaks on the minute until steak is at desired tenderness! 
                Brush steaks with garlic. Remove from heat and place on cutting board and let rest 
                5-10 minutes, serve and enjoy the ultimate <strong><em>Gordon Ramsay Perfect 
                    Steak!</em></strong>
